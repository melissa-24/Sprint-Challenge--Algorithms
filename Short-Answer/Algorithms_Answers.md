#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), The Operations should be equal to the input given a is a constant


b) O(log n), As the input increases so will the nested loops.


c) O(n), This will recursively count 2 ears n times

## Exercise II

I am thinking a binary search.  I would add a counter to count the broken eggs each pass through.
